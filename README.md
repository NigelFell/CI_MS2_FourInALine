        To create a modern look and feel that is familiar to the user who has played the physical version of the Four in a Line game.

    -   #### Typography
        Raleway is the font used on the site. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The Raleway font is an elegant sans-serif typeface.

        Imagery is important but has been kept to a minimum to improve the sites upload time.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the benefits of regular dog grooming and a friendly mobile dog grooming service.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a large animated hero image with cover text describing the image.
        2. As the user scrolls down there's an ethos section communicating the benefits of regular dog grooming, a map indicating the area covered by the mobile service and finally a footer with social media links.
        3. The main points are made immediately with the hero image and ethos section.
        4. The user has several choices to learn more about the organisation. They can click on a navigation bar menu option to access a page to "Contact" the business, view "Prices" or a "Gallery" of photos and testimonials. They can also scroll down the home page to view the ethos section, area covered map and on any page view a footer with social media links for the site that they can access.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website to find content and contact information.

        1. The site has been designed to be easy to use, fluid and not entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly. The current page is indicated by an underline on the appropriate link.
        2. At the bottom of each page in the footer section there is a link to the home page so that the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped when they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the "Contact" page, after a form response is submitted successfully a new window is opened showing the data entered. This will allow the user can easily get back to the website.
        4. The required input boxes on the "Contact" page are marked with an "*". Once the "Contact Us" button is clicked the user input is checked for valid entries where required and the user prompted if there is a problem. The input box and submit button colours change on hover-over to highlight they have been selected.
        5. Checking and verifying a postcode is within the mobile service area has been left to a future release of the site.
    
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to view the area covered by the mobile service in a clear presentation.

        2. On successful submission a page will open in a new window to show their details have been submitted. This will allow the user can easily get back to the website.

    5. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look at a gallery of photos/testimonials to understand what their customers think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        1. The user can easily navigate to the "Gallery" page and view photos and testimonials of existing customers dog grooming experience.
        2. The user can scroll down to the footer of any page on the site and click on a social media link of their choice. The selected social media site will open in a new window to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

        1. The user can easily navigate to the "Prices" page and clearly view a table of prices for different types of dog and grooming options.
